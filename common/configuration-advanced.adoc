              *Configure Network*

a|

Provides options for configuring the network for your {product-title_short} appliance. The appliance is initially configured as a DHCP client with bridged networking.

You can use DHCP to obtain the IP address and network configuration for your {product-title_short} appliance, or use an IPv4 or IPv6 static network configuration by providing specific IP address and network settings.

This menu also provides options to test the network configuration to check that name resolution is working correctly, and to set the appliance's host name.

IMPORTANT: A valid fully qualified hostname for the {product-title_short} appliance is required for SmartState analysis to work correctly.
